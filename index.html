        <p><b>Motorhead</b> — British hard rock band, which had a great influence on the development of all heavy music, in particular, on the occurrence of speed metal, although it is possible to attribute its music to the style of speed metal only with a stretch. The music of the band, rather, can be described as a combination of hard rock, punk rock and proto-thrash.</p>
        <p>The band was formed in 1975 by bassist, vocalist and author of texts Ian Fraser Kilmister, nicknamed Lemmy, who throughout the long existence of the group was her only permanent participant. Motorhead was usually a trio. The band achieved the greatest popularity in the early 1980s, when the album Ace of Spades (1980) received the status of gold, finishing fourth in the British charts, and No Sleep 'til Hammersmith took the first place 5 days after its release. These albums along with Overkill and Bomber consolidated Motorhead's reputation as the main British hard rock band of their time.</p>
        <p>The theme of the band's songs most often is war, the struggle between good and evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, drug abuse and "life on the road." The band's logo, Snaggletooth (War-Pig), first appeared on the cover of the album in 1977 and since then has been in many variations on many other albums of the band. The logo was invented in 1977 by the famous rock artist Joe Petagno. The author of the image commented on his creation: "Inspiration? Of course, I pictured an angry bastard! Such as, for example, Lemmy. I studied the types of skulls for a long time - and eventually came to an excellent combination of a gorilla, a wolf and a dog. Plus, of course, the horns. Well, Lemmy has already added spikes, chains and other ammunition."</p>
