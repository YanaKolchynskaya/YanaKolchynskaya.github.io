        <h1>Some facts from the life of the group</h1>

        <li>Rock and Roll Lemmy fell ill at the age of 16, when he visited The Beatles at the Cavern Liverpool club. It is known that later he bought their first album "Please Please Me" and played under it on the guitar.</li>
        <li>In the late 60's Lemmy was a technician of the scene with Jimmy Hendrix, in the 70's a road manager from Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Then he became a bass player and a vocalist of well-known space rockers Hawkwind, of whom he was exiled in 1975 due to drug problems.</li>
        <li>It is common knowledge that Lemmy is an avid gambler. But, despite the fact that the most famous song Motorhead "Ace Of Spades" ("Ace Of Spades") released in 1980 tells about card games and bones, he himself prefers "one-armed bandits" - slot machines. "I could not sing about how fruit and berries are spinning," he explains. According to rumors, Lemmy put several automats right at home, so as not to spend money somewhere else.</li>
        <li>Respect for the world's rock music stars for Motorhead can be illustrated by one example. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of Lemmy, in the middle of the recording of his new album, Metallica came and performed in full force, dressed and made-up under Lemmy.</li>
        <li>Motorhead is not only powerful, but also incredibly productive. For 29 years they released 21 studio albums of new material, only once making a break for 4 years (1987-91). And the most successful in the US was their penultimate album "Aftershock" (2013).</li>
